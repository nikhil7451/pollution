          <p>
            Air pollution occurs when harmful or excessive quantities of
            substances are introduced into Earth's atmosphere. Sources of air
            pollution include gases (such as ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur
            dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons),
            particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules.
            It may cause diseases, allergies and even death to humans; it may
            also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food
            crops, and may damage the natural or built environment. Both human
            activity and natural processes can generate air pollution.
            Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report. Outdoor air pollution alone causes 2.1 to 4.21 million deaths annually.Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, and is the world's largest single environmental health risk.
            <br> Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year.[9][10][11] Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution.

          <p>
            Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of
            pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart
            disease, COPD, stroke and lung cancer.The human health effects of
            poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's
            respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual
            reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person
            is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual's health
            status and genetics. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality
            are listed as two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in
            the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report.
            Outdoor air pollution alone causes 2.1 to 4.21 million deaths
            annually.Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7
            million people worldwide each year, and is the world's largest
            single environmental health risk. Productivity losses and degraded
            quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the
            world economy $5 trillion per year. Various pollution control
            technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution.

          <h2><span class="color-change">Emitted</span> By Humans</h2>
          <p>
            Pollutants emitted into the atmosphere by human activity include:
            Carbon dioxide (CO 2) – Because of its role as a greenhouse gas it
            has been described as "the leading pollutant" and "the worst climate
            pollutant".[15] Carbon dioxide is a natural component of the
            atmosphere, essential for plant life and given off by the human
            respiratory system.[16] This question of terminology has practical
            effects, for example as determining whether the U.S. Clean Air Act
            is deemed to regulate CO 2 emissions. Sulfur oxides (SOx) –
            particularly sulfur dioxide, a chemical compound with the formula
            SO2. SO2 is produced by volcanoes and in various industrial
            processes. Coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds, and
            their combustion generates sulfur dioxide. Further oxidation of SO2,
            usually in the presence of a catalyst such as NO2, forms H2SO4, and
            thus acid rain is formed. This is one of the causes for concern over
            the environmental impact of the use of these fuels as power sources.

            Pollutants emitted into the atmosphere by human activity include: <br>
            Nitrogen oxides (NOx) – Nitrogen oxides, particularly nitrogen
            dioxide, are expelled from high temperature combustion, and are also
            produced during thunderstorms by electric discharge. They can be
            seen as a brown haze dome above or a plume downwind of cities.
            Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula NO2. It is
            one of several nitrogen oxides. One of the most prominent air
            pollutants, this reddish-brown toxic gas has a characteristic sharp,
            biting odor. Volatile organic compounds (VOC) – VOCs are a
            well-known outdoor air pollutant. They are categorized as either
            methane (CH4) or non-methane (NMVOCs). Methane is an extremely
            efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced global
            warming. Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse
            gases because of their role in creating ozone and prolonging the
            life of methane in the atmosphere. This effect varies depending on
            local air quality. The aromatic NMVOCs benzene, toluene and xylene
            are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukemia with prolonged
            exposure. 1,3-butadiene is another dangerous compound often
            associated with industrial use.

          Keeping hands clean is one of the most important steps we can take to
          avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others. Many diseases and
          conditions are spread by not washing hands with soap and clean,
